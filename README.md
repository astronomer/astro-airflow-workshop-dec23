Astronomer's Airflow + Astro workshop
=====================================

This repo contains workshops designed to give users an intro to Astro, Astronomer's flagship cloud product, as well as familiarize users with the latest features available in Airflow. 

This branch contains information for workshop hosts and contributors.

## Instructions and prerequisites for all workshops

All workshops have their own branch in this repo (see [Choosing a workshop](#choosing-a-workshop) for more info about the different branches). The `README` in each branch contains instructions for the exercises. The file structure is the same as an Astro project, with an additional folder for `exercise-solutions` where relevant.

Workshops are intended to be given in person or virtually, with one Astronomer presenter and at least one other Astronomer helper. Workshop content is not designed for participants to complete asynchronously. 

For each workshop, participants will need:

- An Astro account (a [free trial](https://astronomer.io/try-astro) will work, but ensure it has access to the features covered in the workshop before beginning).
- The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 4.0 or greater


## Choosing a workshop

There are multiple workshops available on different branches in the repository:

- `standard-workshop`: This is the most generic workshop which is appropriate for any use case. It covers basic Astro and new Airflow features. It is designed for participants who are newer to Astro but already have some Airflow experience.

The standard workshop content is the one to choose in most cases.

## Contributing and questions

If you would like to contribute to or request workshop content, or have any questions about the content, please reach out to the DevRel team.
