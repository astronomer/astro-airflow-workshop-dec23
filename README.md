## Overview

Generative AI is now a key part of any data-driven organization’s strategy, for anything from augmenting user-facing applications, to creating new products, to supercharging internal analytics and streamlining operations. Airflow is the leading workflow and data orchestration framework, and the platform on which data and machine learning engineers can unify their workflows, seamlessly integrating data engineering with machine learning operations (MLOps), including LLMOps. In this session, we’ll provide reference architectures for how to leverage Airflow features to operationalize generative AI workflows and how to implement these workflows at scale on Astro.
